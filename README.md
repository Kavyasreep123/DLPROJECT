# DLPROJECT
This project implements a Dialogue Act Classifier using PyTorch, RNN (GRU), and a custom dataset of 500+ sentences.
The model predicts categories such as:
Greeting
Farewell
Thanks
Apology
Question
Request
Anger
Positive
Negative
Confirm
Deny
Command
The user can interact through the terminal — type a sentence and the model will predict the dialogue category.
